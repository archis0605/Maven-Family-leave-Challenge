# Maven-Family-leave-Challenge

## Brief Description
Crowdsourced parental leave data from 1,601 companies across different industries, including paid/unpaid maternity and paternity leave weeks.
As part of Women's History Month in the United States, your company is writing a piece on parental leave policies across the business world and they need you to create an impactful visual using the data you collected.

📌 The core focus of these insights revolves around the observation that a significant number of companies provide maternity leave periods that fall short of the internationally recommended minimum of 14 weeks, encompassing paid and unpaid leave. 


📊Based on these visuals, here are some important insights to improve the company's performance:

👉 Astonishingly, a mere 23% of companies adhere to the standard and offer a full 14 weeks of paid maternity leave.

👉 On average, companies provide 11 weeks of paid leave benefits for new mothers and offer 7 weeks of unpaid leaves which highlights the potential gap during the maternity period.

👉 On average, companies grant new fathers 7 weeks of paid leave benefits while offering 8 weeks of unpaid leave, underscoring the potential disparity in support during the maternity period.

👉 According to ILO Standard, Healthcare leads the negative trend with 71% of the maternity leave whereas Finance follows the positive trend with 65% of the maternity leave.
